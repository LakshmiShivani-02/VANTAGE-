# VANTAGE Roadmap

Our mission is to evolve VANTAGE into the industry-standard environment for agentic geopolitical research.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] GDELT Global Graph integration.
- [x] Initial ReAct agent implementation.
- [x] Tactical Dashboard MVP.
- [x] Scalable pipeline for dataset construction.

## Phase 2: Advanced Reasoning (Q2-Q3 2026)
- [x] **Strategy Simulator**: Injection of hypothetical variables into reasoning loops.
- [ ] **Temporal Memory**: Enabling agents to recall past forecasts and learn from successes/failures.
- [ ] **Advanced Tooling**: Adding support for direct Python-based statistical analysis within the agent loop.

## Phase 3: Global Scale (Q4 2026 - 2027)
- [ ] **Real-time Streaming**: Moving from static batches to live GDELT stream processing.
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture**: Allowing researchers to easily swap LLM backends (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic).
- [ ] **Enterprise Dashboard**: Enhanced analytics for strategic decision-support.

## Research Frontier
- Developing "Anticipatory Logic" benchmarks.
- Improving agentic calibration (confidence scores).
- Relational graph compression techniques.
